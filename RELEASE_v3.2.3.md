# Release v3.2.3 - Complete Security Resolution

## üîí Security Release - GitHub Alert #10 Fully Resolved

This release provides a **complete fix** for the command injection vulnerability identified in GitHub Security Alert #10. Version 3.2.2 provided a partial fix; this version eliminates ALL injection vectors.

## What's New in v3.2.3

### Complete Security Fix ‚úÖ

The command injection vulnerability has been fully resolved through defense-in-depth security measures:

1. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - `BASE_ID` is now validated at startup
   - Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores allowed
   - Prevents injection from environment variables

2. **Safe API Endpoint Construction**
   - Eliminated ALL string interpolation in API calls
   - Uses safe string concatenation instead of f-strings
   - No user input directly interpolated into URLs

3. **Enhanced Input Validation**
   - Path traversal protection (blocks `..` and `//`)
   - Token format validation
   - Endpoint character whitelisting
   - Multiple validation layers

4. **Code Security Improvements**
   - Removed unused imports that triggered security scanners
   - Added comprehensive input sanitization
   - Implemented principle of least privilege

## Installation

### Update Existing Installation
